# MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines
 1. Powerful Data Transformation ðŸ”¥
    - Aggregation pipelines let you manipulate documents in complex ways â€” filter, group, sort, reshape, compute, etc. â€” all within the database.

    - Example: Want total sales per product per month? Done in a few pipeline stages, no need to fetch everything into your app.

 2. Performance Optimization ðŸš€

    - Since everything runs inside MongoDB (close to the data), it's faster than doing computations in your backend. Plus, you can:

    - Use indexes in some stages ($match, $sort)

    - Stream results stage by stage (low memory usage)

 3. Modular, Stage-by-Stage Design ðŸ§±
    - Each stage ($match, $group, $project, etc.) performs a specific job, and you chain them to build complex queries cleanly.
    ```js
    [
        { $match: { status: "active" } },
        { $group: { _id: "$category", total: { $sum: "$price" } } },
        { $sort: { total: -1 } }
    ]
    ```
4. Supports Rich Operations ðŸ§ 
    - Itâ€™s not just filtering or grouping. You can:
    - Do string manipulations
    - Perform date arithmetic
    - Work with arrays and nested fields
    - Join collections ($lookup),etc.

 6. Good for Analytics ðŸ§°
    - You can build reporting, dashboards, real-time metrics, and more, right on your data layer.

# Practice Problems
[Link for Data](https://gist.github.com/hiteshchoudhary/a80d86b50a5d9c591198a23d79e1e467)
## Sample User document
```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "67f1b2e6482706933fdffe48"
  },
  "index": 0,
  "name": "Aurelia Gonzales",
  "isActive": false,
  "registered": {
    "$date": "2015-02-11T04:22:39.000Z"
  },
  "age": 20,
  "gender": "female",
  "eyeColor": "green",
  "favoriteFruit": "banana",
  "company": {
    "title": "YURTURE",
    "email": "aureliagonzales@yurture.com",
    "phone": "+1 (940) 501-3963",
    "location": {
      "country": "USA",
      "address": "694 Hewes Street"
    }
  },
  "tags": [
    "enim",
    "id",
    "velit",
    "ad",
    "consequat"
  ]
}
```
## Q1. How many users in DB are active?

```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      isActive: true
    }
  },
  {
    $count: "Active Users"
  }
]
```

## Q2. What is the average age of the users? **Markdown**:

```js
[
  {
  		$group: {
          _id:null,
          average : {
            $avg : "$age"
          }
      }
  },
]
```
### ðŸ¤” Why Do We Need to Use `$group` to Calculate the Average?

- MongoDBâ€™s **aggregation pipeline** consists of stages, and each stage performs a specific operation.

- To compute values like **average**, **sum**, **min**, **max**, etc., we use the `$group` stage.


### ðŸ“Š Why Group All Documents Into One Group?

If we want the **average age of all users**, we need to treat the **entire collection** as **a single group**.

```js
{
  $group: {
    _id: null,
    average: { $avg: "$age" }
  }
}
```

- `_id: null` â†’ This tells MongoDB to group **all documents together**.
- `$avg: "$age"` â†’ This calculates the average of the `age` field across all documents.



### ðŸ”§ Why Not Just Use `$avg` Without Grouping?

- MongoDB **doesnâ€™t allow** using `$avg` directly outside of `$group` or similar stages.

- You **must** use `$group` to calculate aggregates **across multiple documents**.


### ðŸ§  Analogy

- Think of `$group` as the **calculator stage**.  
Without it, MongoDB processes documents **one-by-one**, not as a set.


## Q3. List the top 5 most common fruit among the user
```js
[
  {
  		$group: {
          _id:"$favoriteFruit",
          count : {$sum: 1}
      }
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      count: -1 //-1 Sort in descending order (from highest to lowest).
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 5
  }
]
```

## Q4. Find the total number of males and females

```js
[
  {
  		$group: {
            _id : "$gender",
            count : {
                $sum : 1
                }
      }
  }
]
```
### ðŸ¤” Why Do We Use $sum: 1 Instead of $count in $group?

#### ðŸ“Œ The `$count` Operator vs. `$sum: 1`

| Feature | `$count` | `$sum: 1` |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Type | **Pipeline stage** | **Accumulator inside `$group`** |
| Use Case | Count **total number of documents** in the pipeline | Count **number of documents per group** |
| Placement | Used as a **standalone stage** | Used **inside** a `$group` stage |

## Q5. Which country has the highest number of registered user
- we can simply drill down to object with just `.` operator
```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$company.location.country",
      userCount: {
        $sum: 1
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      userCount: -1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  }
]
```

## Q6. List all the unique eye colors present in the collection
```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$eyeColor",
    }
  },
]
```

## Q7. What is the average number of tags per user
### Option 1
- `$unwind` stage takes an array field in a document and splits it into multiple documents, each containing one element from the array. The rest of the documentâ€™s fields are duplicated in each of these new documents, with only the array element being different.
```js
[
  {
    $unwind: {
      path: "$tags",
    }
  },
  {
    $group : {
      _id : "$_id",
      numberOfTags : {
        $sum : 1
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group : {
      _id : null,
      averageTags : {
        $avg : "$numberOfTags"
      }
    }
  }
]
```
### Option 2
- `$size` aggregation operator, **counts** and **returns** the total number of items in an array.
- we use `$ifNull` for error handling, if we don't find **tags** property in document then treat it like `[]` empty array
```js
[
  {
    $group : {
      _id : null,
      avaerageNumberOfTags : {
        $avg : {
          $size: {$ifNull : ["$tags",[]]}
        }
      }
    }
  },
]
```

## Q8. How many user have 'enim' as one of their tags?
- we can also use `"tags" : "enim"` which works same but when we use `$in`, we can also check for multiple values if we want to.

```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      "tags" : {"$in" : ["enim"]}	
    }
  },
  {
    $count: 'UsersWithEnimTag'
  }
]
```

## Q9. What are the names and age of users who  are inactive and have 'velit' as a tag?
- we can select which properties we want to forward in the next stage using `$project`, also we can add new computed properties using this.
```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      tags : "velit",
      isActive: false
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
		name:1, age:1, _id: 0
    }
  }
]
```

## Q10. How many users have a phone number starting with +1 (940)
- use **Regex** to match pattern
```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      "company.phone": {$regex: /^\+1 \(940\)/}
    }
  },
  {
    $count : "UsersWithPhoneStartsWithSpecificPattern"
  }
]
```

## Q11. Who has registered most recently?
```js
[
  {
    $sort : {
      "registered" : -1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  },
  {
    $project: {
      name: 1, registered: 1, favoriteFruit:1
    }
  }
]
```

## Q12. Categorize the user by their Favorite Fruit
- `$push` pushes specified value(s) in a array for each document in group
```js
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$favoriteFruit",
      users : {$push : "$name"}
    }
  }
]
```

## Q13. How many users have 'ad' as the second tag in their list of tags?
- we can use `.` operator to access index of array
```js
[
  {
    $match: {
      "tags.1": 'ad',
    },
  },
  {
    $count : "SecondTagAd"
  }
]
```

## Q14. Find Users who have enim and id as their tags.
- `$all` selects array which contains all specified elements
```js
[
    {
        $match : {
            tags : {$all : ["enim", "id"]}
        }
    },
]
```

## Q15. List all the companies located in USA with Their corresponding user count.

```js
[
    {
        $match : {
          "company.location.country": "USA"
        }
    },
 	 {
     $group : {
       _id: "$company.title",
       Users : {
       		$sum : 1
       }
     }
   }
]
```

## Sample Authors Document
```js
{
  "_id": 100,
  "name": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
  "birth_year": 1896
}
```
## Sample Books Document
```js
{
  "_id": 1,
  "title": "The Great Gatsby",
  "author_id": 100,
  "genre": "Classic"
}
```

## Q16. Get Books with their author details
To join documents from the `books` collection with their corresponding author details from the `authors` collection, we use the `$lookup` stage in the aggregation pipeline.

### `$lookup` Fields Explained:

- **`from`**: The name of the **foreign collection** to join with (e.g., `"authors"`).
- **`localField`**: The field in the **current collection (`books`)** that you want to match.
- **`foreignField`**: The field in the **foreign collection (`authors`)** that should match the local field.
- **`as`**: The name of the **new field** in the output documents that will store the matched author details as an array.

```js
[
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "authors",
      localField: "author_id",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "author_details",
    }
  }
]
```
