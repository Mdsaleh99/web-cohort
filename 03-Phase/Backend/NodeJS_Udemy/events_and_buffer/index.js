What are Events in Node.js?
    Node.js follows an event-driven architecture
    where actions (events) trigger specific responses.
    The EventEmitter class in the events module is used to handle events in Node.js.
    Events in Node.js work like a publisher-subscriber model
    where an event is emitted and event listeners (handlers) respond to it.


Why Use Events?
    Helps in asynchronous programming without callback hell.
    Used heavily in real-time applications like chat apps, notifications, and str
    Core modules like fs, http, and stream use events internally.
