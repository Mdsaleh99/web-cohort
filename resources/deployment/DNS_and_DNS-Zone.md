## 🌐 What is a **DNS Zone** (Explained Simply)

A **DNS zone** is basically the **control panel for your domain’s DNS records** — it’s the section of the internet’s “phone book” that stores all the instructions for how to reach your website, backend API, email, etc.

Think of it like this:

> 📖 **DNS (Domain Name System)** = the phone book of the internet.
> 📁 **DNS Zone** = the page in that phone book dedicated to *your domain*.

### 📍 Example:

If your domain is `zeros1.com`, the **DNS zone** for it contains records like:

| Type  | Name | Value              | Purpose                     |
| ----- | ---- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| A     | @    | 203.0.113.25       | Point main domain to server |
| A     | api  | 203.0.113.25       | Point API subdomain         |
| CNAME | www  | zeros1.com         | Redirect `www` → root       |
| MX    | @    | mail.yourhost.com  | Email delivery              |
| TXT   | @    | v=spf1 include:... | Email authentication        |

👉 All these records **live inside the DNS zone** for your domain.

## 🛠️ DNS Zone in Cloud Platforms (like ExCloud, DigitalOcean, etc.)

When you see **"DNS Zone"** in a cloud platform (like ExCloud, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, etc.), it usually means:

* They’re offering to **host your DNS** (instead of GoDaddy or another registrar).
* It’s the place where you **add, view, and manage all DNS records** for your domain.
* It tells the internet how to route requests for your domain and its subdomains.

---

### 🧰 How It Works in Practice

Let’s say:

* You bought your domain from **GoDaddy**.
* You deploy your backend/frontend on **ExCloud**.

You have two choices:

---

### 🛣️ Option 1: **Keep DNS at GoDaddy** (most common)

* Leave your DNS zone at GoDaddy.
* Just add **A records** there pointing to your ExCloud server’s IP.

✅ Easy and beginner-friendly.

---

### ☁️ Option 2: **Use ExCloud DNS Zone**

* You move your DNS zone to ExCloud.
* You add DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, etc.) **inside ExCloud’s dashboard**.
* Then, at GoDaddy, you change the **nameservers** to point to ExCloud.

✅ More control and automation, but one extra step.

---

### 📦 Real-World Example

If you add a domain like `zeros1.com` to ExCloud DNS:

* ExCloud creates a **DNS zone** for `zeros1.com`
* Inside that zone, you add:

| Type | Name | Value        |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ |
| A    | @    | 203.0.113.25 |
| A    | api  | 203.0.113.25 |

* Then you update GoDaddy **nameservers** to ExCloud’s.
* Now, the internet reads DNS records from ExCloud instead of GoDaddy.

---

### 🧠 Quick Analogy

* 📇 **DNS:** The global phone book of the internet.
* 📁 **DNS Zone:** The specific page that contains your domain’s “contact info.”
* 🏢 **ExCloud DNS Zone:** ExCloud is hosting that page and letting you edit it directly.

---

✅ **In short:**
A **DNS zone** is the part of DNS that stores all the records for your domain. On platforms like ExCloud, it’s where you configure how your domain and subdomains map to servers, APIs, email services, and more.

---

#### If you’re using **Excloud (or any other external platform)** to manage your **DNS zone**, then GoDaddy is **no longer responsible** for DNS. In that case, **you don’t add A/AAAA/CNAME records in GoDaddy anymore** — instead, you **point your domain’s Nameservers to Excloud**.

---

### 🧠 Step-by-step: What to change in GoDaddy when using Excloud DNS Zone

1. **Login to GoDaddy** → Go to **“My Domains” → Manage Domain**.
2. Scroll to the section called **“Nameservers”**.
3. By default, it will show something like:

   ```
   nsXX.domaincontrol.com
   nsYY.domaincontrol.com
   ```

   (These are GoDaddy’s default nameservers.)
4. Click **“Change”** and choose **“Custom Nameservers”**.
5. Enter the nameservers provided by **Excloud DNS zone**.
   Example (they’ll give you two or more):

   ```
   ns1.excloud-dns.com
   ns2.excloud-dns.com
   ```
6. Save changes ✅

---

### 📍 What happens after that

* Once you change nameservers, **GoDaddy only acts as the domain registrar.**
* All **DNS records (A, CNAME, TXT, MX, etc.)** will now be managed **inside Excloud**.
* That’s where you will:

  * Point `zeros1.com` → your Caddy/Frontend server IP (A record)
  * Point `api.zeros1.com` → your Backend server IP (A record)
  * Add TXT records (e.g., for SSL or email verification)

---

✅ **Summary:**

* If you use **Excloud DNS zone**, you must **replace GoDaddy’s default nameservers** with the ones from Excloud.
* After that, do **all domain pointing and DNS setup inside Excloud**, not GoDaddy.
