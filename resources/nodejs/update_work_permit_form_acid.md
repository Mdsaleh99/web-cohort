# Work Permit Form Update Controller (Deep Dive with ACID Properties)

This document explains the **updateWorkPermitForm** controller in depth, covering:

1. Step-by-step logic of the controller.  
2. How **Prisma Transactions** work.  
3. How ACID properties apply to this controller.  
4. Why transactions are critical for maintaining data integrity.

## 📌 Controller Overview

The `updateWorkPermitForm` controller updates a **Work Permit Form** with its nested **sections** and **components**.  

Entities involved:
- **WorkPermitForm**
- **WorkPermitSection**
- **WorkPermitSectionComponent**

Operations required:
- Update form title.  
- Add, update, or delete **sections**.  
- Add, update, or delete **components** within each section.  

This involves **complex relational updates**, which is why transactions are needed.

## ⚡ Prisma Transaction

Prisma provides transactions to ensure **atomic operations**.

### Types of Transactions

1. **Batch Transaction (`$transaction([queries])`)**
   - Executes multiple queries together.
   - All succeed or all fail.

2. **Interactive Transaction (callback style)**
   - Pass a callback with dynamic queries.
   - More flexible for loops and conditional logic.

👉 The controller uses **interactive transactions** because it needs to **diff incoming vs. existing data** and perform conditional updates/deletes.

## 🛠 Controller Step-by-Step with Transaction

### 1. Validate Input
- Ensure all required params exist (`workPermitFormId`, `companyId`, `userId`, `title`).
- Fetch company & form to confirm existence.

### 2. Start Transaction
```ts
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // all updates here
});
```

### 3. Update Form
```ts
await tx.workPermitForm.update({
  where: { id: workPermitFormId },
  data: { title, updatedAt: new Date() },
});
```

### 4. Handle Sections
- Extract existing vs. incoming section IDs.
- Delete missing sections (`deleteMany`).
- Update existing ones (`update`).
- Create new ones (`create`).

### 5. Handle Components
- For each section:
  - Extract existing vs. incoming component IDs.
  - Delete missing components (`deleteMany`).
  - Update existing ones (`update`).
  - Create new ones (`create`).

### 6. Return Final Result
Fetch updated form with sections & components in sorted order.

## ⚖️ ACID Properties in Action

Transactions in databases guarantee **ACID** properties: **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability**.  

Let’s apply each to the controller:

### 🔹 Atomicity
- **All-or-nothing** execution.  
- Example: If a new section is created but component creation fails, **no updates persist**.  
- Ensures partial updates don’t corrupt the form.

### 🔹 Consistency
- Ensures the DB moves from one valid state to another.  
- Example: If a section is deleted, its components are also deleted (`onDelete: Cascade`), keeping referential integrity.  
- Prevents dangling components with no parent section.

### 🔹 Isolation
- Concurrent transactions don’t affect each other.  
- Example: If two users edit the same form at once, Prisma/DB ensures **one transaction commits fully before the other sees changes**.  
- Avoids race conditions like one deleting a section while another is adding a component to it.

### 🔹 Durability
- Once committed, data persists even after crashes.  
- Example: If the server crashes after the transaction commits, updated form data remains safely stored in PostgreSQL.

## ✅ Why ACID Matters Here

- Without **Atomicity** → you could end up with a form missing sections but with orphaned components.  
- Without **Consistency** → deleted sections might leave components behind, breaking schema rules.  
- Without **Isolation** → two admins editing could overwrite each other’s changes.  
- Without **Durability** → a crash during update might lose committed data.  

Thus, ACID ensures **form data integrity and reliability**.

---

## ⚠️ Key Notes
- Use `deleteMany` for cleanup of removed entities.  
- Always validate `label` and `title` before creation.  
- Keep transactions short to avoid **deadlocks**.  
- Use **indexes** (already in schema) for faster lookups.  

---

## 🔑 Takeaways
1. Prisma transactions ensure **safe nested updates**.  
2. ACID guarantees that even with deletes + creates + updates, the database stays consistent.  
3. The frontend acts as the **source of truth** → backend syncs DB with incoming JSON.
