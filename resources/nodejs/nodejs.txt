Global Objects in Node.js
In the browser, the global object is window.

In Node.js, the global object is called global.
Example:
console.log(global);
This will show methods like setTimeout, setInterval, and more.

Important note:
console.log(this); // {}
At the top level in Node.js, this does not refer to the global object.



What is globalThis?
To solve these differences across environments, ECMAScript 2020 introduced globalThis.

    In browsers, globalThis refers to window.
    In Node.js, globalThis refers to global.

This gives us one consistent way to access the global object, no matter where our JavaScript code is running.
